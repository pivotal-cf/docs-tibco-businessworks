This documentation describes the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack for VMware Tanzu. The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack provides the runtime component for developers to deploy BusinessWorks applications to VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (formerly Elastic Runtime).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition enables you to quickly and easily connect APIs, Microservices, and legacy backend systems. With an easy-to-use drag-and-drop graphical development environment, graphical data mapper, and vast library of connectors, you can create cloud-native integration applications and run them natively on VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (formerly Elastic Runtime).

When you push a BusinessWorks application to a VMware Tanzu deployment, the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack detects the BusinessWorks application, produces a tarball called a "droplet" that contains a lightweight version of the BW runtime along with the application files, and configures the runtime to run the application when the container starts.

To build applications for the runtime provided by the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition Buildpack, use the TIBCO Business Studio for BusinessWorks development environment. See [Requirements](index.html#reqs) for more information.

The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition runtime simplifies creation of cloud-native integration applications using any of the following integration styles:

* **Batch-oriented**: provides non real-time integration for endpoints such as databases or files, and uses records for data abstraction
* **Process-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as application APIs and adapters, and uses APIs, objects, and messages for data abstraction
* **Service-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as web services and APIs, and uses services and messages for data abstraction
* **Resource-oriented**: provides real-time integration for endpoints such as mobile or web applications and APIs, and uses resources for data abstraction

The TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition runtime natively integrates with Spring Cloud Services for VMware Tanzu to support Service Registry/Discovery, Configuration Management and Circuit Breaker pattern.

For more information about the TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition runtime, see the TIBCO [documentation](https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-businessworks-container-edition).
